    "history_head_description": "Voice of God Tabernacle was founded by Pastor Jean-Claude Dupuy in 1995, after moving to the capital, Ottawa, that same year. Having found no Christian congregation believing in the Message of the Hour, he felt compelled to start modest meetings with his family and other believers in the basement of his house. He strongly believed it was a privilege to bring the children of God and his family, who worshiped with him, back to the source (the Voice, Malachi 4:5-6) that the Lord Jesus Christ had planned before the foundation of the world.",
